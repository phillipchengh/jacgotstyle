            External Vice President: Kevin Zuo
          </div>
          <div class="officer-description officer-bottom-radius">
            Kevin's just a stupid anime nerd. He only watches anime while he plays World of Warcraft. He's recently given up anime completely to watch Black sitcoms from the 90's. If you love crappy video games, crappy anime, and crappy humor, you should definitely hit him up. Also, he'll wreck you in basketball, Runescape pvp, and the Neopets Battledome so don't trifle with him.

            Born and raised amidst gang violence and other heinous acts of crime in the notorious city of Oakland and shooting people left and right for the past couple of years or so, Henry has grown to love doing it enough to be willing to shoot up the members of JAC for the 2014-2015 school year (with a camera in case you couldn't tell you already!). He has previously served as JAC's secretary and internal vice president. He is fond of most genres of anime and manga and has a particular liking towards series made by Sunrise and titles directed by the infamous Gen Urobuchi. His other hobbies including trading card games, cosplay, singing, and dancing (despite not being able to do the latter two properly enough yet).

            Hi. I am a second year Aerospace Engineering major. I have watched anime since I was a child but did not dive into the culture and branch out with my tastes until high school. I was born and raised here in California in Orange County. My first convention was AX 2012. This is the first anime club that I joined. On top of being an anime fan, I am also a Vocaloid fan.

            If you want a cool senpai, look no further. She's the rockstar from "The City" (San Francisco). She loves to dance ballet, hip hop and jazz and she has a black belt in kung fu so she can protect her little kouhais. She maxed out Tetris Battle after selling her soul and social life to the Tetris Gods. Now she is Tetris God and she spends her time collecting souls of other people who also aspire to become Tetris God while watching anime at the same time. She just started getting into cosplay so you can talk to her about that too!
