          If you want a cool senpai, look no further. She's the rockstar from "The City" (San Francisco). She loves to dance ballet, hip hop and jazz and she has a black belt in kung fu so she can protect her little kouhais. She maxed out Tetris Battle after selling her soul and social life to the Tetris Gods. Now she is Tetris God and she spends her time collecting souls of other people who also aspire to become Tetris God while watching anime at the same time. She just started getting into cosplay so you can talk to her about that too!
